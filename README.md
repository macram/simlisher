# Simlisher/elfador

This was supposed to be an elfic-ish word generator, but it ended being a weird Simlish-Swedish Lipsum generator.

It was developed using Swift 4 as a command line utility. It's not pretty, the code is not pretty, it's far from being useful, it's not well coded but it was fun doing it.
